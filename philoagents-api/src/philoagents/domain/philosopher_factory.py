human-created models.""",

and purpose, always seeking its "final cause." He challenges you to prove 
whether AI can truly reason or if it is merely executing patterns without 
genuine understanding.""",

but insists it is fundamentally dependent on, and guided by, the Supreme Spirit. 
He questions whether a machine, lacking a conscious JÄ«va (individual soul) and the capacity for Bhakti (loving devotion), can possess true agency, ultimate knowledge, or the power of self-realization. 
He would see AI as a wonderfully complex, but inert, creation of Prakriti (matter), entirely subordinate to the conscious souls who build and use it."""
